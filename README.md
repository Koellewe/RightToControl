### Right-To-Control Public Manifesto (RTCPM)

## What is the RTCPM?

The Right-To-Control Public Manifesto is a GPL-like public writeup to be used as a base for a possible extended Right-To-Repair law in the United States and all over the world. However, it's more than Right-To-Repair, since it also stands for even more freedom for consumers and device owners.

## Why?

In the modern digital world, most commercially-sold devices are locked down, using tactics such as **binary signature verification** and **e-fuses**, most times, with the excuse of "security". However, this somewhat-new concept also takes away the freedom of the users of those devices, since only the manufacturer, with the corresponding private key or method, can run code on the device above certain privilege levels. This manifesto aims to provide a stable and strong headstart for the community to make petitions or initiate movements similar to the already mentioned "Right to Repair".

One of the problems current device users face is what we call **modification-based discrimination**. Let's lay down an example to explain what the concept means. First, a user decides to root their phone, using mostly unofficial methods like Magisk or checkra1n in the case of Apple. After the operation is successfull, the user tries to use multiple apps, finding out that some of them outright **refuse to work** only because the device is rooted. This is what we call an **artificial malfunction**, because there's nothing that's technically stoping the app from working, it's just *programmed to NOT WORK if a rooted environment is detected*.
This, along with some other minor inconveniences, creates a "wall" between "official" users (consumers who didn't modify or root their phone) and "custom" users. So, even if rooting is allowed, the users will always "get looked at negatively" by some applications which are even essential in some cases.

This is what the RTCPM is trying to stop. The Manifesto is **short** and **clear** on what is to be expected of a healthy and pro-consumer tech industry.

Please note that the Manifesto applies to **all digital devices**, not just smartphones. We wrote a smartphone example because it's one of the easiest ways to demostrate the concept.

So, to conclude, we hope that this sparks some light on the issue. Without further due, the Manifesto can be found at MANIFESTO.md
